        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 faq-block">
                <h3>WHERE IS IT?</h3>
                <p>
                    University of Toronto Scarborough,
                    IC Instructional Centre,
                    1095 Military Trail, Scarborough,
                    ON M1C 1A4, Canada
                </p>
                <h3>WHO CAN APPLY?</h3>
                <p>
                    Any college or university student is eligible to apply.
                </p>
                <h3>ONCE I AM ACCEPTED, WHAT DO I NEED TO BRING?</h3>
                <p>
                    You’ll need: A laptop and charger. Everything else is optional. However, we strongly encourage you to bring a sleeping bag, pillows, toiletries, and a couple of changes of clothes.<br><br>
                    You won’t need: An idea, or a team. You can create your own team (teams of 4 recommended) during the hackathon, and generate some amazing creations along the way. You also don’t need to worry about food, we’ve got you covered.
                </p>
                <h3>WHEN WILL APPLICATION CLOSE?</h3>
                <p>
                    Please apply before January 31st.
                </p>
                <h3>DO YOU PROVIDE TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENTS?</h3>
                <p>
                    We are unable to provide travel reimbursements, but we have a bus going to McGill, Queens and Concordia!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 faq-block">
                <h3>WHEN/WHERE CAN I HACK?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hack The Valley will start with the kick-off ceremony. There will be events planned throughout the day for those who arrive early. A detailed schedule of events and locations will be posted later. All work eligible for prizes must be completed between Friday night after the kick-off and Sunday morning at the hacking location (TBA). We will not accept any projects that were started prior to the hackathon (e.g. continuations of personal projects).
                </p>
                <h3>HOW MUCH WILL HACK THE VALLEY COST ME?</h3>
                <p>It’s completely free, so don’t worry! We'll provide you with a weekend's worth of meals, drinks, and snacks and a place to crash when you need a break from coding. In fact, you’ll probably walk away loaded with all the swag that you’ll get at Hack the Valley.</p>
                <h3>WHAT CAN I WIN?</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s not about winning-it’s about exploring your passion while making great friends (which if you ask us, is a BONUS!!!). But if you’re a fan of winning, we’ve got you covered. We’ve got some great prizes in stock (will be announced soon). A panel of professional judges will select the best three hacks based on the following criteria: creativity, functionality, level of technical difficulty and quality. Most sponsors like to offer their own prizes as well for specific categories which are evaluated themselves.
                </p>

                <h3>HOW IS HACK THE VALLEY RUN?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hack The Valley is planned almost entirely by (sleep-deprived) University of Toronto students, with some advice and assistance from our friends at the Department of Student Life (DSL), Association of Mathematical and Computer Science Students (AMACSS) and Computer and Science Enrichment Club (CSEC). One hundred percent of the funding for Hack the Valley comes from corporate sponsor donations.
                </p>
                <h3>I'M NOT A STUDENT, SO HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED?</h3>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we can't allow you to participate in the event or be on site during hacking. If you're looking to mentor (i.e. someone with technical skills who'd be willing to help out participants during the weekend), you should reach out to us at mentoring@hackvalley2.com . Otherwise, you can see the finished products at the demos on Sunday (time and location TBA). Thank you for your interest, and we hope to be able to incorporate you in the future.
                </p>
                <h3>HAVE MORE QUESTIONS?</h3>
                <p>Feel free to shoot us an email at sponsor@hackvalley2.com  if you have any more questions.</p>
